# Machine-Learning
Some machine learning project I made during my master in Computer Science reguarding deep learning.

**Advanced Machine Learnign**: here you can find all the projects I made in the course "Advanced Machine learning" during the second year:

- **Assignement 1**: The assignment consists of predicting default payments using a neural network. The dataset includes information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, payment history, and bill statements from credit card clients in Taiwan, covering the period from April 2005 to September 2005. The provided data includes both a labelled training set, which can be used for training (and optionally for validation), and an unlabeled test set.

- **Assignement 2**: The assignment consists of three different tasks: the investigation of the effects of regularization on the modelâ€™s performance, the implementation of a simple auto-encoder and The exploitation of latent representation of auto-encoder for prediction. The dataset proposed for the assignment is a custom version of multi-mnist. The dataset is created by simply concatenating pairs of MNIST digits and the number of classes (originally all the numbers in the [0, 100] range) has been reduced.

- **Assignement 3**: Design and train a CNN with up to 7000 trainable parameters to obtain the best results on the MNIST dataset

- **Assignement 4**: The task is next character prediction in a text. Starting from the provided skeleton of the code:properly divide the sequences into training, validation and test. Eventually use an external text for the test to assess the generalization ability; evaluate the trained model in terms of prediction accuracy; tune the chunk length to obtain the best performance; modify the network architecture to obtain the best performance

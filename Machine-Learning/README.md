# Machine-Learning
Some machine learning project I made during my master in Computer Science reguarding deep learning

- **Assignement 1**: The assignment consists of predicting default payments using a neural network. The dataset includes information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, payment history, and bill statements from credit card clients in Taiwan, covering the period from April 2005 to September 2005. The provided data includes both a labelled training set, which can be used for training (and optionally for validation), and an unlabeled test set.

- **Assignement 2**: The assignment consists of three different tasks: the investigation of the effects of regularization on the modelâ€™s performance, the implementation of a simple auto-encoder and The exploitation of latent representation of auto-encoder for prediction. The dataset proposed for the assignment is a custom version of multi-mnist. The dataset is created by simply concatenating pairs of MNIST digits and the number of classes (originally all the numbers in the [0, 100] range) has been reduced.

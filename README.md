Some of my Master degree progects:

- Machine Learning: here you can find some of my machine learning projects

- Causal Network: here you can find two main projects: my implementation of the code of the paper "Finding minimal d-separators in linear time and applications" by Benito van der Zander and Maciej Liskiewicz, and a presentation that I made about the paper "Simpson Paradox in Covid-19 case fatality rates: a mediation analysis of age-related causal effect" by Julius von Kugelgen, Luigi Gresele, Bernhard Scholkopf

# Causal Network
Those are the projects I made for this course in my University. In particular:
- **Simpson's Paradox**: this is a presentation about a paper I had to study about the paradox in Covid-19 case fatality rates when comparing the Chinese and Italian data
- **Finding minimal d-separator**: this is the practial project, where I implemented the algorithms of this paper
